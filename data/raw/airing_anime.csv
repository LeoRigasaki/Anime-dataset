A beautiful teacher risks her life to protect the students held captive in a storehouse, but when she's taken to a large hall, she finds the men stark naked and erect. With their clothes torn off and tortured relentlessly on the spot, her body reaches its limits. The teacher, losing her mind, offers up her students as scapegoats. Meanwhile, the three students left behind in the storehouse have their clothes stripped and their hands and feet bound. One by one, their bodies are trained by the villagers, until they are physically and mentally broken and reduced to human slaves. <br><br> (Source: Mediabank, translated)",JP,True,,https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/bx198344-LVBMXsAdeHU5.png,#e45d5d,,,,,A-suke Shinogi (Original Creator),,True,,https://anilist.co/anime/198344,1766221960,1770303600,2,2025-12-21T04:29:02.860648+00:00,anilist
