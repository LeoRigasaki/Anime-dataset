Her name is Alps. And this is a dangerous forest where many terrible creatures lurk. But Alps is frightened and goes on her way. To save her sick sister, she continues to walk out of the forest with a medicinal herb in her hand. Alps is still walking, <i>""Wait for me. Sister"".</i> However, the forest is not as sweet as one's determination. A big monkey in heat forced her to sow her seed, and a boar attacked her with his huge body. Furthermore, she also encounters a group of men of dubious character.... The lone, dainty girl is nothing but food for the beasts. What will be the fate of Alps?... Alps wanders through a dangerous forest to save her sister. Her white soft skin emerges in the dimly lit forest. The huge body of a boar, a big monkey in heat, rests on it. A glossy pink color emerges on her heated body.<br> <br> (Source: Getchu, translated)",JP,True,,https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/medium/bx195033-U5Y8Hy5zbnMC.png,#5daee4,,,,Alps,x-rabbit (Original Creator);Manpiece (Planning);Yukitoshi Motoyama (Producer);Mihiro (Storyboard);Tokku03 (Script),,True,Alps and the Dangerous Forest,https://anilist.co/anime/195033,1770600390,0,0,2026-02-09T05:23:35.402553+00:00,anilist
